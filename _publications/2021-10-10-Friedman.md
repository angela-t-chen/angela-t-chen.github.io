title: "Evaluation and disposition of older adults presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-10-10-Friedman
excerpt: 'We sought to characterize the evaluation, management, and disposition of older adults who present to the ED with abdominal pain, finding that abdominal pain in older adults presenting to EDs is a serious condition yet is triaged to "emergent" acuity at half the rate of other conditions. As such, opportunities for improving diagnosis and management of these patients may exist.'
