Hello! I'm a third-year MD/PhD student, which means that I've completed two years of medical school at the Perelman School of Medicine and am currently in my first year of PhD studies in the [Health Care Management and Economics](https://hcmg.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/phd/) program at the Wharton School. I'm also an Associate Fellow and the [Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics](https://ldi.upenn.edu/), and an Associate Director of Research at the [Center for Surgical Health](https://www.centerforsurgicalhealth.org/), where I work with a talented and driven medical community to improve surgical equity. 

I graduated from Wharton undergrad in 2016, concentrating in Health Care Management and Policy, and then spent the following year at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China as a member of the first class of [Schwarzman Scholars](https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/). Before returning to Penn for my current graduate studies, I worked in research at the [Orthopaedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research](https://oracore.bwh.harvard.edu/) with Drs. Jeffrey N. Katz and Elena Losina, and also collaborated with Dr. Winnie Yip at the [China Health Partnership](https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/china-health-partnership/). 

My current research interests include unscheduled care, equity and access to care, health economics, and global health care systems. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, running, and playing tennis, as well as learning about data science and pop culture from my fiance, [Richard Kuzma](https://rskuzma.github.io/). 

I'm thinking about being a surgeon-scientist someday, so if you have thoughts on that career path, want to discuss research generally, or have any questions - please reach out! I'd love to connect.
