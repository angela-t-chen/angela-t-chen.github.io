permalink: /publication/2021-12-13-Song
excerpt: 'In this study, we examined the extent to which being designated as an essential or non-essential worker impacts one's risk of being COVID-positive following the non-essential business closure order in Pennsylvania. We also assessed the intrahousehold transmission risk experienced by their cohabiting family members and roommates. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we estimated that workers designated as essential have a 55% higher likelihood of being positive for Covid-19 than those classified as non-essential; in other words, non-essential workers experience a protective effect. We also found evidence of intrahousehold transmission that differs in intensity by essential status.'
