This project sought to fill a gap in the sports medicine literature about injury types and rates specifically among marathon runners in the United States who participate to raise money for charity. We 1) estimated the rate of injury among members of the 2019 Stepping Strong Marathon Team, and 2) determined the types of injuries that most frequently plagued these runners. We found that approximately one quarter of respondents reported impairment in ability to walk as a result of pain or injury due to running. Though 76% of respondents developed pain at some point during the marathon training cycle, 88% indicated they would run a marathon again.
