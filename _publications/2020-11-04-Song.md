excerpt: 'This study aimed to measure the extent to which the provision of mammograms was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding guidelines. Over the 20 weeks following March 11, 2020, the volume of screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms fell by 58% and 38% of expected levels, on average. Lowest volumes were observed in week 15 (April 8 to 14), when screening and diagnostic mammograms fell by 99% and 74%, respectively. Results indicate that the provision of mammograms has been significantly disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.'
