title: "Budget Impact of Funding an Intensive Diet and Exercise Program for Overweight and Obese Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-11-19-Smith
excerpt: 'Diet and exercise (D+E) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) is effective and cost-effective, but cost-effectiveness does not imply affordability. We estimated changes in undiscounted medical expeditures (2016 US dollars) with and without a D+E program. Although there is no established threshold to define affordability, our results suggest that a D+E program for knee OA would likely produce expenditures comparable with outlays for other health-promotion interventions.'
