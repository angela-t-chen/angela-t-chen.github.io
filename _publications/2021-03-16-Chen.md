permalink: /publication/2021-03-16-Chen
excerpt: 'Nursing homes were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, but it was not known whether some were more successful at mitigating outbreaks among residents than others. In this study, we found that in communities with high COVID-19 prevalence, there were significant inequities in infection rates among nursing homes with larger proportions of racial minority residents and Medicaid participants. In addition, facilities with fewer direct patient care hours were more susceptible to virus spread.'

Nursing homes were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, but it was not known whether some were more successful at mitigating outbreaks among residents than others. In this study, we found that in communities with high COVID-19 prevalence, there were significant inequities in infection rates among nursing homes with larger proportions of racial minority residents and Medicaid participants. In addition, facilities with fewer direct patient care hours were more susceptible to virus spread.
