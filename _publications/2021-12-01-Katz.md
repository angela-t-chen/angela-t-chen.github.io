title: "Factors associated with use of antibiotic prophylaxis following dental procedures in total joint replacement recipients"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-12-01-Katz
excerpt: 'We created and mailed a survey to over 1000 potential participants who underwent ttotal joint replacement (TJR) between 2011 and 2016 to understand prophylactic antibiotic use among this population. Our results showed that two-thirds of these TJR recipients reported always using antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental visits. Usage rates varied by demographics, BMI, number of TJRs, type of dental procedure, and behavioral factors -- but not by comorbidities associated with higher prosthetic joint infection risk.'
