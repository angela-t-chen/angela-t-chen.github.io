excerpt: 'This paper was a systematic review to summarize quantitative evidence on crowdsourcing to improve health. We found that crowdsourcing has been used to improve health in many settings, including to evaluate surgical skills and improve sexual health messaging. More research is needed on crowdsourcing as a tool to develop artifical intelligence systems in medicine.'
