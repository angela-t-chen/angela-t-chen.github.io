title: "Estimating contextual effect in nonpharmacological therapies for pain in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic analytic review"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-05-19-Chen
excerpt: 'In this paper, we conducted a systematic review and used meta-analytic techniques to estimate the proportion of total treatment effect that can be attributable to contextual effects (PCE) in adults receiving nonpharmacological, nonsurgical (NPNS) treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Our findings suggest that about 61% and 69% of the total treatment effect experienced by subjects receiving acupuncture and topical energy modalities (TEM) treatments, respectively, for knee OA pain may be explained by contextual effects. Contextual effects may include the placebo effect, changes attributable to natural history, and effects of co-therapies. These data highlight the important role of contextual effects in the response to NPNS OA treatments.'
