title: "Gluteal fibrosis, post-injection paralysis, and related injection practices in Uganda: a qualitative analysis"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-11-06-Alves
excerpt: 'In this paper, we used qualitative methods to describe perceptions of local health care workers regarding risk factors - particularly injection of medication into the gluteal region - for development of gluteal fibrosis (GF) and post-injection paralysis. Results suggest that inappropriate intramuscular injections, may arise from problems in the upstream deficits in access to health care, health education, and health policy enforcement.'
